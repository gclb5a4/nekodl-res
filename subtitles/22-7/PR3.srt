and I'm from Saga.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're both from Kyushu.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So I'm really looking forward to today!

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The mission has been completed.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first one.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's make the PR event successful with HMV and Rooks Hakata.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to make it successful with the two of us.

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The second one.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to make the PR event successful with Dazai Futen Mangu.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm so happy.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I heard that you were going to make the PR event.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I was expecting it.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm so happy.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I want to make the PR event successful and eat Ume-gai mochi.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll ask you to teach me many things.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to make the PR event successful with the anime.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll do my best in Fukuoka.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The third one.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I want to make the PR event successful with the two of us.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I made it.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yay.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you for your hard work.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you for your hard work.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We're on the spot.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're going to have a talk event.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to talk about Kyushu.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm looking forward to it.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll go.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll go.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you.

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I came to Fukuoka today thanks to everyone.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm really happy.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm so happy to be in Kyushu.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want to have another event here.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Please come to Fukuoka.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm back in Fukuoka.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Welcome back.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The event is over.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I had a talk with Kyushu, my favorite city.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It was fun.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sure I want to come to Fukuoka.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to come to Fukuoka.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I arrived in Mangu.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yay.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I used to go to Kourei-gi with my family every year.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to take Kanaeru, which I have never been to, to Fukuoka.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to take her there.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to go there.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Really?

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Can I?

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's warm.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's fresh and fresh.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you for the meal.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll enjoy having this.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's good.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There are red beans in the rice cake.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The noodles are thin and have a nice texture.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's delicious even when it's cold.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But, the warm rice cake is more delicious.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The rice cake is very chewy and delicious.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want everyone to eat it when it's fresh.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's delicious.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's delicious.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's delicious.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's delicious.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm not good at making Tsubuan, but I can make Ume-gan-muchi.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I see.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Everyone is lining up.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you touch the rice cake, you can act better.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Where should I touch?

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to make a good voice.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I want to say my favorite thing is my mouth.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mouth.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mouth.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a mouth organ, so I want to keep my mouth and throat healthy.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wow!

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's difficult.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's difficult!

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can remember it very well!

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's beautiful!

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There are a lot of people.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When I was taking the exam, I got a 500 yen ticket.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It was expensive.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,160
This one looks cute!

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,600
Ready, go!

113
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:08,639
Hope these soap operas open in Jan 2012 will be successful!

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,980
The story of Photoshop

115
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,379
Okay, we're done!

116
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,439
It's done!

117
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,060
Tada

118
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:50,060
The first episode of the TV anime will be a huge hit!

119
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,060
We've been doing the pre-recording for the first episode, and everyone is thinking about acting.

120
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,060
We're working hard with a lot of staff, so I hope it will be a big hit.

121
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,060
I hope everyone in Japan will watch it!

122
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:22,060
We've successfully completed the second mission!

123
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,060
I'm really happy to be with the members of the TV anime.

124
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,060
The omegai mochi was delicious, too.

125
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,060
I was happy.

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I hope my wish will come true.

127
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
The Katabara is here!

128
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
It looks delicious.

129
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
I'll enjoy it.

130
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,060
I spent a day in Fukuoka.

131
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,060
I talked to Reinya about Fukuoka.

132
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,060
I feel relieved to hear the sound of the sound of the wind.

133
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,060
I feel better.

134
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
The TV anime will start in January 2020.

135
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
The TV anime will start in January 2020.

136
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
The TV anime will start in January 2020.

137
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,060
I'm looking forward to it.

138
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,060
I think it's an anime that will meet everyone's expectations.

139
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
Please look forward to it.

140
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,060
I hope everyone in Kyushu will see our growth.

141
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Please watch the anime from January.

142
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Thank you.

143
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Thank you.

144
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Thank you.

145
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
Thank you.

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Thank you.

147
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Thank you.

148
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Thank you.

149
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Thank you.

150
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
Thank you.

151
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Thank you.

152
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
Thank you.

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Thank you.
