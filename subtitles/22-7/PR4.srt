1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Osaka

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Osaka

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Osaka

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Wow!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We came to Osaka!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm from Shiga prefecture, so Osaka is very close to me.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, I came to this beautiful world with my friends.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I did a lot of fun things.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've only been to Osaka by one hand.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm looking forward to today.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Really?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, I am.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let me say it.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm happy to be in the new world.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm happy to be in the new world.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mission card is here.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll open the first one.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's eat Kashi-katsu as a hit meal.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yay!

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Kashi-katsu!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm happy.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Next,

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's watch the Tower Records' Osaka Maru Building 2 and make the PR event a success!

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I did it!

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm always in your care.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We are in your care.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We are in your care.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm looking forward to the event.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll go now.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
See you.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll eat a lot of Kashi-katsu to make it a hit.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I can't wait to see the view.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's a good day.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We're going to win here.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm happy.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I won.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's this?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm happy.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Two Kashi-katsu are in my side.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The one who can eat Kashi-katsu is the winner.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Really?

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No way.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What game do you play?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know but I can only eat one of these.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What game do you play?

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh!

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Word Tying Sheet?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The answer is...

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I see.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The answer is...

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Group!

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's difficult.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can't use these kinds of nouns.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But what about groups?

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What about the other ones?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What about the other ones?

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want to play the game.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Group?

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's difficult.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's Rii.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Rii?

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Rii.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please do Rewind properly.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You often do it, right?

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You often do it, right?

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Rewind.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Rewind.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you do it in Kansai dialect, you will be in trouble.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll do it.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Rii. Rii.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yanchamusume.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Why is it wrong?

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I think Jun Toda and Yancha are in charge of Yancha.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If you can do that, anything is possible.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What?

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yanchamusume.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ne.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Ne.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Ne.

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ne.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ne.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Ne.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ne.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ne.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I see one.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I found one.

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I found one, too.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What should you do in the order of makeup?

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is a group.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There is a group.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There are groups, right?

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can do it in order.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can do it freely.

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can do it freely.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You can do it freely.

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There are many of them.

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What should I do?

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Roo?

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Roo is difficult.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Roo is really difficult.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,539
Ruby is the only one that comes up in the chat.

104
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,539
That's true.

105
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,039
I don't want to name the members.

106
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,240
I feel sorry for you.

107
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Ruru.

108
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Ruru.

109
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Ruru.

110
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Ruru.

111
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Ruru.

112
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Ruru.

113
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Ruru.

114
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,240
Let's keep the rules.

115
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Yay.

116
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I've never said that.

117
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Kanae said something.

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Which one?

119
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I said, I'm not going to watch.

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Don't say that.

121
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Let's keep the rules.

123
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Ruru.

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Ruru.

125
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Ruru.

126
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Ruru.

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Yay.

128
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Let's do our best.

129
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Miyako is close.

130
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
Right?

131
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Yes.

132
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm Na.

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Na, Na, Na.

134
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Nalala.

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Na.

136
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Nalala.

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Na.

138
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Nalala.

139
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Na.

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Na.

141
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Nalala.

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Nalala.

143
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Nalala.

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Nalala.

145
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Na.

146
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
If I say it's wrong, it's not good.

147
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,000
I did it!

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,240
There are many people who say, if you say it wrong, it's not good.

149
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
There are people who say it's wrong, right?

150
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
There are many people who say, it's not good.

151
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm the winner.

152
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Kushi katsu is eaten by Osaka women.

153
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm not a Shigayan.

154
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
It looks delicious.

155
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
I want to eat it.

156
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,240
It's a Japanese style kushi katsu.

157
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,240
It's amazing that you can eat Japanese style kushi katsu.

158
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm very happy.

159
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I'll eat the eggs that I like.

160
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
I'll eat it.

161
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Do I have to take out the insert?

162
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Insert is okay.

163
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
I'll take it out.

164
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I'll eat it.

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
It's forbidden to put it on twice.

166
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
I put it on.

167
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
It looks delicious.

168
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
It made a good sound.

169
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,240
It's delicious.

170
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,240
It's crispy and the inside is soft.

171
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
The meat is delicious.

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm sorry.

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
I'll eat the original taste.

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I'll eat it.

175
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm happy.

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
It's delicious without the sauce.

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
It's delicious.

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
The taste of meat is delicious.

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
I'm happy.

180
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
I wanted to win.

181
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
It was a hit anime.

182
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
I ate the original taste.

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
I'll buy my anime.

184
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I couldn't eat it, but Mizuha ate it.

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm full of power.

186
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I'll go to Osaka Umeda Marubiruten.

187
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
I did it.

188
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm happy.

189
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
I'm happy.

190
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
I'm happy.

191
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm happy.

192
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm happy.

193
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,240
