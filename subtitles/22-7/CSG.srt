The

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,000
next

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
a

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
song

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
a

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
song

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
.

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I

12
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
would like

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to

14
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
introduce myself

15
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
one

16
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
word

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
everyone

.

24
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you.

25
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you.

26
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes,

27
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I was

28
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
looking forward to

29
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
seeing you

30
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000

31
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you

35
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll do my best

36
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
not to be

37
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
exposed

I'm

Akane

I'm

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,020
The

62
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,359
last

63
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,000
due

University

66
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:04,799
Three

67
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,200
second

68
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,879
speaker

69
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,439
Everyone

70
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,000
entered

71
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
the

72
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,599
elevator

73
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,000
.

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
However,

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
this

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,799
students

77
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,460
what

79
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,799
Yes

80
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,359
yes

81
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,159
Ky Nikara

82
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,219
this

83
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,299
song

84
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:22,900
Konnichi

85
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,599
go

86
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,159
to

87
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:26,719
that

88
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,000
near

89
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,700
between

90
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,799
will

91
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,799
I can't say anything.

92
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,799
But that's the first episode, so I want you to pay attention to their relationship.

93
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:48,799
I want you to pay attention to their relationship that you can't see on the YouTube channel.

94
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,799
I see.

95
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
How about the other members?

96
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:05,799
Well, I want to see Reika Sato's nickname when everyone meets her.

97
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,800
I'll do it myself.

98
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
I want you to see her nickname.

99
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
It's coming soon.

100
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm looking forward to it.

101
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I wonder what they'll say.

102
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
I wonder what they'll say.

103
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
How about you?

104
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm a maniac.

105
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
In the first episode, Miyu is working part-time.

106
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I think it's already been released on PV.

107
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
There's a scene where she talks to the person who's on the way to work.

108
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
It's not on the PV yet.

109
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Miyu is thrown the words that she said at the pre-recording.

110
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Where's Miyu?

111
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Why do you lose sight of me?

112
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
I wonder what kind of line it was.

113
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
It's a horizontal line.

114
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
It's a horizontal line.

115
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
It's a horizontal line.

116
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
That's pretty much...

117
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
It's not life, but it's a very decent thing.

118
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
I think it's very memorable.

119
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
The performers in the Afreco booth were also in a lot of trouble.

120
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I hope you'll pay attention to that.

121
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I see.

122
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
That's good.

123
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Let's ask you something else.

124
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
How about you, Ms. Shiro?

125
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
This is the story of Akane Mariyama, who I play.

126
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,800
There's a scene where Akane writes in the first episode.

127
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Actually, the characters are the characters that I, Akane Shirosawa, wrote.

128
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Is that so?

129
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Yes.

130
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,800
My characters are Akane's characters, so please pay attention to them.

131
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
That's good.

132
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,800
If you don't listen to that, you'll miss it.

133
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,800
But the characters are all the characters that we wrote.

134
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Is that so?

135
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes.

136
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I see.

137
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
That's a good point.

138
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Please pay attention to the characters.

139
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
How about you, Ms. Miyase?

140
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I often have a quarrel with Ayaka Tachikawa, who I play.

141
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:10,800
There's a line that I say to that member when she's sitting in a chair.

142
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Nanananana...

143
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
No, no, no.

144
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
You don't have to say that much.

145
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
You don't have to give me that much hints.

146
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm really lost right now.

147
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
But...

148
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I really like the line,

149
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
It's called,

150
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Yay, I heard.

151
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
At the time of the recording,

152
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,800
the members told me that they were looking forward to the line.

153
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I see.

154
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I really enjoyed recording.

155
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
That's good.

156
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
How about you, Kawase?

157
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Yes.

158
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
As you can see from the second PV,

159
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,800
the character I'm playing is called Black Nicole.

160
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
It's a strong-looking Nicole.

161
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm surprised by the way she's acting.

162
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I was surprised by her.

163
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Especially for Miyu.

164
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
She's got some strong words.

165
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
And she's got a high pride.

166
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
And she's got a professionalism.

167
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
She's got everything.

168
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Please pay attention to that.

169
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I see.

170
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Well, there's a relationship.

171
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Yes.

172
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
How about you, Saijo?

173
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Is there anything you can see?

174
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Well...

175
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Miyu Takigawa, who I play,

176
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I think you've only seen her in the beginning.

177
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
But in the anime,

178
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
in the first or second episode,

179
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I think you'll see a little strong Miyu in the next episode.

180
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I hope you enjoy Miyu who you don't usually see.

181
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I see.

182
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm sure that's what you're worried about.

183
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
That's good.

184
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
There were many good scenes for the seven characters.

185
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Yes.

186
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
It's seven times more fun to watch.

187
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
That's right.

188
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
This is wonderful.

189
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Thank you.

190
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Thank you.

191
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Thank you.

192
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Well, we've heard about the highlights.

193
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Next, I'd like to talk about the song.

194
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,800
This time, the opening and ending will be in charge.

195
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I think this is amazing.

196
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
How was the opening?

197
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
First of all, Saijo.

198
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It's hard.

199
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It's a song called Muzui.

200
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I've already shown it at the live show.

201
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
It's a song that starts with my lines.

202
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
In the song, everyone says a line one by one.

203
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
What is it?

204
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Personally, I think I heard Ruri Ruri, Umino Ruri-chan's lines.

205
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I think it's Jun-chan.

206
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I see.

207
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Everyone has their own way of saying lines.

208
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I think it's a good way to say it.

209
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I want you to pay attention to it.

210
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I see.

211
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I see.

212
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
It's good.

213
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
It's a song plus.

214
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm also interested in the lines.

215
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
There's also an ending.

216
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Yes.

217
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
The ending theme is a song called Emerald in the sky.

218
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
When I listen to the lyrics, I'm really in conflict.

219
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
It's a very frustrating lyrics.

220
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,800
But when it comes to the chorus, it's a very refreshing song that's going to the future.

221
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's a TV anime.

222
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I think the TV anime is 22 out of 7.

223
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,800
I think it's about the conflict between the girls who became idols.

224
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I think it's a song that's very linked to that kind of content.

225
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
I see.

226
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I hope you look forward to it.

227
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Yes.

228
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
When each character is dug up in the anime.

229
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Yes.

230
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's called the Oto-Bankai among us.

231
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Yes.

232
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
That's right.

233
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Please dig your nose and teeth.

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I wonder if that's how much each character is featured.

235
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I was told to dig my nose and teeth.

236
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Please dig your nose and teeth.

237
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Please dig your nose and teeth.

238
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Please dig your nose and teeth.

239
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm digging my nose and teeth.

240
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Dig your nose and teeth.

241
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I actually dug my nose and teeth.

242
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I dig my nose and teeth.

243
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Well, you can say that you can tell what kind of character you are by digging your nose and teeth.

244
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
That's right.

245
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
That's right.

246
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
What is it?

247
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
That's why I'm acting.

248
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Fujima Sakura who I play plays the role of a kindergarten student.

249
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I played the role of Sakura in the anime.

250
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Sakura's voice is high.

251
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:26,800
When I play Sakura in the anime, I can't help but measure the age of the character.

252
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,800
If I raise the voice of Sakura higher than the current voice, it will sound like a mosquito.

253
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,799
I can't hear you.

254
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,799
Only teenagers who are watching this anime can enjoy the anime.

255
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,799
Please stop.

256
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,799
It's hard.

257
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,799
Let the old man say something.

258
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,799
I can't hear you.

259
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,799
Sakura is a kind and kind girl.

260
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:54,799
When I was a child, I was kind, but I didn't listen to my child's selfishness.

261
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,799
I tried to live with a little bit of words.

262
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,799
I see.

263
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,799
Next, I would like to hear from KAHASHI.

264
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,799
I said it earlier.

265
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:15,799
Nicole is very strong-minded, proud and professional.

266
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,799
What is Nicole's personality?

267
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,799
What happened?

268
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,799
What kind of encounter did Nicole have?

269
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,799
I'm really impressed with the reason.

270
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,799
I want to say it, but I can't.

271
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,799
I can only say this.

272
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,799
No, no.

273
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,799
I'm just happy to hear that.

274
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,799
I'm looking forward to it.

275
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,799
I agree.

276
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,799
Nicole's episode is very exciting.

277
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,799
I will do my best to act.

278
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,799
I hope you will pay attention to it.

279
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,799
I'm glad.

280
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,799
I'm glad to hear that this will be in the next episode.

281
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,799
I'm glad to hear that this will be in the next episode.

282
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,799
Everyone is really emotional.

283
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,799
Really?

284
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,799
Really?

285
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,799
I cried while I was on a trip.

286
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,799
Really?

287
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,799
After the first episode, everyone clapped naturally.

288
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,799
That's amazing.

289
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,799
That's right.

290
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,799
I'm glad.

291
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,799
Do you have any thoughts, MIYASE?

292
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,799
I have a lot.

293
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,799
I'm sure you have a lot.

294
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,799
I have a lot.

295
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,799
I will also act in my childhood.

296
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,799
Ayaka is in her early, middle and early childhood.

297
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,799
Wait a minute.

298
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,799
Let's change the age.

299
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:42,799
When was the prime?

300
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,799
When was the prime?

301
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,799
When I was a child.

302
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:51,799
I played various Ayaka's time.

303
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,799
I think it's very characteristic.

304
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:01,799
I was able to grow up reading the script in my own way.

305
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,799
Certainly.

306
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,799
The leader is laughing all the time.

307
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,799
What is it?

308
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,799
Okaze-san.

309
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,799
I'm serious.

310
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,799
I'm serious.

311
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,799
Listen to me.

312
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,799
MIYASE-san is talking about the prime.

313
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,799
I'm kidding.

314
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,799
I'll listen.

315
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:25,799
Then, I would like to ask you how you do the recording.

316
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,799
How about you, Umino-san?

317
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,799
Yes.

318
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,799
Since it's recording, there is a microphone work.

319
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,799
It's a microphone that can be used as a microphone.

320
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,799
I'm not good at it.

321
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,799
So, at the beginning, I didn't know which microphone to put in.

322
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,799
There are four microphones.

323
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,799
I was wondering which microphone to put in.

324
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,799
While everyone was talking, it moved like this.

325
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,799
It's like a half-spawn.

326
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,799
The sound is also noise.

327
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,799
Was it moving that much?

328
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,799
It moved a lot.

329
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,799
After the test, the director said,

330
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,799
Jun-chan, don't defend yourself.

331
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,799
Defense?

332
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,799
Soccer.

333
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,799
Sports defense.

334
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,799
It's a sports defense.

335
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,799
It's really moving.

336
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,799
It's moving.

337
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,799
Is it that difficult?

338
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,799
Who is the best at that microphone?

339
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,799
KAWASE-Uta-chan participated in the recording in the middle.

340
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,799
But she was able to put it in.

341
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,799
She is better than me.

342
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,799
KAWASE-san.

343
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,799
It's amazing.

344
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,799
What is it?

345
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,799
Nice to meet you.

346
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,799
Nice to meet you.

347
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,799
Nice to meet you.

348
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,799
Nice to meet you.

349
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,799
Nice to meet you.

350
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,799
What about you, KAWASE-san?

351
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,799
I think I have the talent for defense.

352
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,799
Is that your talent?

353
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,799
You're avoiding defense.

354
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,799
I'm avoiding it.

355
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm afraid it's an offense.

356
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,799
I'm afraid it's an offense.

357
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,799
When it came to KAWASE-san,

358
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,799
SAIJO-san was very obedient.

359
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,799
Are you good at it?

360
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,799
I'm good at it.

361
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,799
I'm good at it.

362
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,799
When I go to the other two, the staff is visible.

363
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,799
I only use these two.

364
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,799
Is that the intention?

365
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,799
Is there such a bond?

366
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,799
Was there such an intention?

367
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,799
So I don't know what they were doing there.

368
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,799
I don't know what they were doing.

369
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,799
I see.

370
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,799
You know about these two.

371
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,799
But it's interesting.

372
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,799
Maybe you have a personality.

373
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,799
Yes.

374
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,799
What about you, KOKAZ?

375
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,799
Well, other than the membership, I think.

376
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,799
I'm with other cast members.

377
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,799
I see.

378
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,799
That's right.

379
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:37,799
We have relatively little voice acting experience.

380
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,799
It's hard to say.

381
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,799
I can't say it many times.

382
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,799
I can't express my feelings.

383
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,799
I want everyone to do it at once.

384
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,799
I want everyone to step on my feet and say it.

385
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,799
Everyone tells me.

386
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,799
I'm experiencing that.

387
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,799
I think it's something that everyone does.

388
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,799
I feel like a TV anime.

389
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,799
I feel it on the spot.

390
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,799
But I'm happy.

391
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,799
You can absorb it on the spot.

392
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,799
That's right.

393
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,799
Thank you.

394
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,799
So, you're growing up in the one-by-one recording.

395
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,799
I think so.

396
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,799
That's right.

397
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,799
We say it ourselves.

398
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,799
That's right.

399
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,799
I'm grateful.

400
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,799
You can learn a lot.

401
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,799
I can learn.

402
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,799
I can absorb it.

403
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,799
That's why.

404
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,359
Really?

405
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:30,799
Go to that party with me.

406
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,799
Next~!

407
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,799
I'm really happy.

408
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,799
Thank you.

409
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,799
To be honest,

410
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,799
you don't have to get off the stage.

411
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,799
If he goes to the venue,

412
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,799
watch the show.

413
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,399
I feel like my shoulders are lighter and easier to carry.

414
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,899
I'm always grateful for the words you give me.

415
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,399
So it's really a team play.

416
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,199
Yes.

417
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,599
Of course, you're a team member, but you're also working with other cast members.

418
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,899
Yes, we're really helped.

419
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:12,699
That's great.

420
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,899
How about you, Shirosawa-san? Do you have any stories about recording?

421
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:26,299
About recording? Well, I have a story about a new voice actor sitting near the door and taking a break.

422
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,100
I heard that's what it's like.

423
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,899
Yes, that's what I heard.

424
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,000
And since it's in everyone's heads, there's a group of members who sit near the door.

425
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,199
There is.

426
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,899
What do you mean?

427
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,500
You want to sit there?

428
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,899
I want to sit there.

429
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:41,799
You want to open the door?

430
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,899
I want to open it.

431
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,299
You want to be a door girl?

432
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:45,399
I want to be one.

433
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,600
Why?

434
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,100
Why?

435
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,600
Who's the newest?

436
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,899
I've been sitting there for a long time.

437
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,600
I've been sitting there for a long time.

438
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,899
I've been sitting there for a long time.

439
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,700
It's a little different from the time of the recording.

440
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,399
It's a little different.

441
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,700
It's like, I'm going to leave the door today.

442
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,600
I'll go somewhere else.

443
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,300
That's right.

444
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,100
I see.

445
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,600
So it's interesting.

446
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,200
You're building up your experience.

447
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
That's good.

448
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,800
So I've been listening to it like this.

449
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Well, after all, the story of the anime.

450
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,500
Well, after all, the story of the anime.

451
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,799
I'd like to ask you one last time.

452
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,600
I'd like to ask you how you feel about this anime being broadcasted.

453
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,100
First of all, please, Mr. Amaki.

454
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,899
Yes, that's right.

455
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,299
After all, the anime's theme is the story of the beginning.

456
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:34,899
I'm going to tell you the story of their future activities.

457
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:41,200
I think 2020 is a new beginning for us.

458
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,700
For those of you who have been supporting us for three years since we were formed.

459
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:54,100
I hope that those who have been coming in from the middle of the calculation will continue to support us in 2020.

460
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,500
Thank you.

461
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Thank you.

462
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Thank you.

463
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Thank you.

464
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,300
Now, let's ask another person.

465
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,500
How about Kawase?

466
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,300
Yes.

467
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,100
I'm new to the company.

468
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm really excited every day.

469
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,299
I'm recording over and over.

470
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,400
Of course, Nicole.

471
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,100
Characters.

472
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,500
Everyone.

473
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:14,900
Really.

474
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,400
Really.

475
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,100
I'm a good girl.

476
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,300
Even if you look at it objectively, it's a really good anime.

477
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,800
I think it's a work that makes you think that it's really good.

478
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,600
From episode 1 to episode 12 and episode 13 of the extra episode.

479
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
I hope you can watch it without missing out on the first episode.

480
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,700
Thank you.

481
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Thank you.

482
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,200
Thank you.

483
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
The more I hear this, the more I'm looking forward to it.

484
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm saying.

485
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,100
I think I'm thinking about it myself.

486
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,800
Finally, here.

487
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,600
Can you say a word from Mr. Hokazu?

488
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes.

489
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Thank you very much for coming to the pre-show today.

490
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,100
No, I've talked about a lot of things.

491
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Well, it's amazing.

492
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,900
With laughter.

493
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,300
With tears.

494
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm really, really happy to be able to deliver it to you as a TV anime that was shot at the American set.

495
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,900
All 12 episodes.

496
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,200
And extra episode 13.

497
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,800
11 of them.

498
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,299
Please watch their story to the end.

499
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,799
Thank you.

500
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,799
Thank you.

501
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,799
Thank you very much.

502
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,700
bör어

503
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,799
because

504
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,799
ha

505
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
because

506
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,059
Arira

507
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,799
Aje

508
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,799
Prue

Aww
