1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first day of the first single

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The first day of the first single

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first day of the first single

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first day of the first single

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm Chiharu Okazaki

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm Nao Saizo

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I came to Nagoya for the PR mission!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What should I do?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The first single campaign

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm here

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is my first time

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But I definitely want to go to Nagoya

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Because my character Reika Sato is from Nagoya City, Aichi Prefecture

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Is that so?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I'm happy to be here today

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mission

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here's the first one

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What is Shabani?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hint

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Animals

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Animals?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you mean?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The second one

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's make the PR event successful at the Tower Records Nagoya Parkotenn

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yay!

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Two missions came out

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What is Shabani?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to do a lot of PR for everyone in Nagoya today

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's go!

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Shabani

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's look it up

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm writing a photo book

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Shabani

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Shabani's Takiya

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Shabani is...

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This Higashiyama Doshogabashi

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is in this Doshogabashi

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here I am

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's fast

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you cross the bridge

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can get close

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't do it anymore

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ah

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ah

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Looks like you navy

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Trying to cross the bridge

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Ooh

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hard

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Good

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is he doing?

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm very good at it

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm saying so

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you happy?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I said it

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But it won't work

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is점

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you looking at?

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Disgusting

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Uh

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Cute!

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Cute!

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
She is staring at me!

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
She is quite young.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
23 years old.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She is very young.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Nagomi, you should do it!

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You look so cool!

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I was so impressed.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She gave me a fan service.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Did you see it?

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I saw it.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Her eyes are round.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She is so cute.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I finished it.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will show you the other side.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will show you the other side.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ta-da!

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The title is, I love your eyes.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Her eyes are very unique.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I wrote it down.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Reika is born with it.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I will put it on her.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will put it on her.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will put it on her.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I see it on her whole body.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I am 75 years old.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I did it!

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I am happy.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I am happy.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's delicious.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I am the first animal of Hayato.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I am the first animal of Hayato.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I love your eyes.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is a Riddle Triple.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Your eyes are so good.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Look at her eyes and find out.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I will tell you,

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
my taste never fails to fills thoughts.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sarah still Klar�s.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There is a little LINES history in this message.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So that is your challenge in reading T TO Content ?

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It makes me most talkative aboutش

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Especially with your name on it.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you reading ajaran to the next show?

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am looking at the CC and thinking about that

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So we've completed the first PR mission!

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yay!

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Next, we're going to the Tower Records Nagoya Paracote to have an event.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We'll do our best!

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We're going!

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is Rika-chan's red.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is Yuu-chan's white.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is Yuu-chan's penlight color.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Since it's Hokaze and Nagomin,

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm Ho-gomin.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm really happy to have come to the event.

121

With this,

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I hope that the group 7分の22 will be known to many people,

129
