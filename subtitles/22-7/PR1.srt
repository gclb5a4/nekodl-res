1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The day of the trip

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The day of the trip

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The day of the trip

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The day of the trip

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm Chiharu Okazuchi. I'm Ruri Ueno.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today is the PR mission of the year.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We came to Hokkaido Sapporo.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We came!

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I went skiing in Kushiro on a school trip to Hokkaido.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I couldn't go sightseeing at that time because it was Sapporo today.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's not a sightseeing, but I came here today.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I ate a lot.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's delicious.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm glad to be here.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm a grandmother.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My mother and father-in-law are both grandmothers in Hokkaido.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I came here last in April this year.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I come here often every year.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm glad to be here at my grandmother's place.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to promote a lot.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to promote a lot.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's black!

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I thought the mission was a bit strange.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is it a mission?

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is it?

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The equipment Mie-chan gave me is a special one.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go!

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's take a picture of the current in the glass pyramid of Moere-numa Park.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is that so?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's go this way.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's go to the Tapporo Kiboten Tower Record and make the PR event a success.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Please do this.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I want to make it happen.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
PR mission

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's go!

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's go!

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Have you been to Moere-numa Park?

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I may have heard of it for the first time.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's not at all.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I always shoot for the single.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Everyone has a very pretty face.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Pretty face.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel like that.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a very natural image.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I see.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You look good.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're cool.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you have any special talents, please say so.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a talent.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a talent.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're cool.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You're cool.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Snow?

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's snowing.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It was snowing a lot.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's snowing a lot.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We arrived at Moerenuma Park!

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Look at this view!

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Isn't it amazing?

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Where should we take a picture?

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Where is the glass pyramid?

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't know where it is.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We are going to the glass pyramid.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What is that?

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Isn't it that?

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's amazing!

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's big!

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's big!

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's big!

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's big!

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's big!

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's amazing!

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's amazing!

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's snowing!

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's so beautiful.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's snowing.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We should take a picture here.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We should take a picture here.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wow!

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We should take a picture of the mountain.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We should take a picture of the mountain.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We want to use the mountain as a background.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We can use the pillar.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This?

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a produce.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not a produce, but it's normal.

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We should build the bridge.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The bridge?

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Instçƒ›

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,539
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:15,539
You're fast.

97
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,540
I'm still...

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's perfect.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm back.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm embarrassed.

101
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,000
Your face is in a good shape.

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My eyes.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Your eyes are flowing.

104
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
How do you pose?

105
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
How do I pose?

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can put my feet down.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Put your feet down.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You said you wanted to go to your sister today.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going to take a picture with you.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Your sister.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You look like a last boss.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Look down.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's good.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's good.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's good.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is it.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm wearing a white bag.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I see.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you haven't seen the anime so far, you should watch this.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The first mission is completed.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I did it.

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was fun.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was fun, wasn't it?

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm excited.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm excited.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And there's another mission.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're going to go to Tower Records in Sapporo.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We're going to go to the pivoting store.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We're going to succeed.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We'll get the attention of the audience.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We're going to the main store now.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We're going.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We're going to Sapporo.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We're going to the pivoting store.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's right.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a black and white store.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We'll do our best.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a black and white store.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We'll do our best.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bye bye.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We'll do our best.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have a lot of leading roles, right?

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I would like to do that.

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'd like to do that.

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I would like to do that.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I look forward to watching the anime, starting in January.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's me.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's me.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thank you.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you very much!

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Meat!

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm happy.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Milk!

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Milk?

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hokkaido people came to see us.

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, they did.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Some of them said they've never been to Japan before.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm really happy to be able to come to various places like this.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I want to do a live show with everyone next time.

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I agree.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We'll do our best!

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We'll do our best!

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So please look forward to our TV show!

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We'll do our best!

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We'll do our best!

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you for watching!
