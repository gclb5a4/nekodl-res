00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Tokyo

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,940
Tokyo

00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,500
Tokyo

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Tokyo

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Tokyo

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Tokyo

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Tokyo

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Tokyo

10
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Tokyo

11
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Tokyo

12
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Tokyo

13
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Tokyo

14
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The last mission for this year is Tokyo!

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We've been doing a lot of things together before, but we've changed the number of people in Tokyo.

16
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, now we're having fun!

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're having so much fun!

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, it's exciting!

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, I got it!

20
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I got it for the first time!

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, that's right!

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ta-da!

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's make a phone game that will make the heart and the members together!

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If it's us, then it's a game.

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a phone game, right?

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a game.

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a game.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's one more.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Here we go.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ta-da!

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's make the PR event at Tower Records Shibuya store a success!

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wow!

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to do that.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's do our best together!

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's do our best!

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's the point of success?

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't know.

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't know.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's do our best and succeed!

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I want to do my best!

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll go!

43
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's go!

44
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow!

45
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a good one.

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
English!

47
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please say the following words in the pronunciation of the words written in the title.

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I decided to be the last one.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I see.

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Even if you make a mistake, you can do it.

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Please do it.

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The order of the order is a problem.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I agree.

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sure it's a good start.

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the English professional, Sunny, who is the most popular.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I see.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sunny is the first leader.

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What should I do?

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't do it.

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll be the first.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please do it.

64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I often go with Nagomi, who is very popular.

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She is Nagomi who is the second.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I used to study English.

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
She used to correct the movement in the middle when I made a mistake at the beginning.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Can you do it?

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have to fix it.

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Will you fail here?

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know why I failed.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know.

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll teach you how to correct the movement.

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll do my best.

75
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's move.

76
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll move.

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll move.

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll move.

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I heard that everyone can't hear me.

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Can't you hear me?

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can't you hear me?

82
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You are stupid.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You are too cute.

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think I can do it.

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Listen carefully to Steve.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He is really caso shield.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What about here?

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Filham coffee.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Filham coffee.

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And slice carrot cake.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please?

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is it perfect?

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll have medium coffee plus slice carrot cake, please.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll have medium coffee plus...

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Slice carrot cake, please.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I did it.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll have medium coffee plus slice carrot cake, please.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll have coffee.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll have...

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll have coffee.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Medium coffee.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll have medium coffee.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Plus...

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll have.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Slice carrot...

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't think I can do this one.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Cut the small carrots.

113
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think it's better to do this.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You mean, slice carrot cake.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Slice carrot, please.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Please.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it possible?

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll have...

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll have...

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll have...

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll have...

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Medium coffee.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll have medium coffee.

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Medium coffee.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Slice carrot.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Slice carrot.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will have medium coffee.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you very much.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will have medium coffee.

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And medium carrot.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Medium carrot.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please carrot.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not sure.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I heard you said please carrot.

140
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think I'm the first one.

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will have medium coffee.

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Carrot please.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And carrot please.

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Carrot please.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Carrot.

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Medium coffee and carrot.

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And carrot.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why is Sally the last one?

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't trust carrots, so I'll buy them.

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's the answer.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Certainly.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sally, please answer.

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will have medium coffee and carry out please.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I fixed grammar, but it's a little bit different.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't say carry out.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I see.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I say medium coffee and take out please.

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But take out is to go.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The answer is.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will have medium coffee and a slice of carrot cake please.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Slice.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Carrot.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Carrot.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Carrot.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Carrot cake has become a carrot.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Carrot.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Carrot cake hasn't come.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Carrot cake hasn't come.

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Carrot cake hasn't come.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Carrot cake hasn't come.

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a mobile-correcting system.

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Carrot.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I heard it when I heard it from the kitchen.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I heard it when I thought of a picture in my head.

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
At that time,

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I thought it was a salad bar.

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I see.

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I thought it was a salad bar.

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a salad bar.

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's fashionable.

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Slice carrot.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Slice carrot.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I see.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Mission failed.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's a one-time chance.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is there any other chance?

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a movie.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a movie.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's difficult.

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
!

192
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:24,180
A everyone who is not good at it

193
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,019
Doing research...

194
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:31,139
rebound

195
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Drum andi

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm going to play it.

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I wonder if it's working.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's cute.

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm nervous.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I see.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I see.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I see.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Can I play it?

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to play it.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What should I do?

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm going to play it.

208
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What?

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How should I play the New Year's card?

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's good, isn't it?

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to play it.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm going to play this.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm going to play it.

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Would you rather play the picture well or play it more fun?

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I am not sure.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm going to tap it.

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But, understand it if this is here.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
By the way.

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wait.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I might have changed.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What?

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Holy crap.

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,620
states that

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,679

227
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,940

228
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,820
there are aX himself

229
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:23,820
'' I have a medicine. ''

230
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,440
what are they doing?

231
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,940
Wait, wait.

232
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,640
I got it!

233
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,240
Wait a minute.

234
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,540
What?

235
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,440
I got it!

236
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,540
I got it!

237
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,540
I got it!

238
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,340
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

239
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,040
I see, it's easy to guess.

240
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,840
But what should I do?

241
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,140
I got it wrong.

242
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,840
What else?

243
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,340
I don't need anything else.

244
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
I got it!

245
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
I got it!

246
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,139
I got it!

247
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:22,639
I got it!

248
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,340
I got it!

249
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,740
I got it!

250
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,340
I can do it.

251
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,939
Really?

252
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,039
Yes.

253
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,639
I got it!

254
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,439
I think I got it.

255
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:39,439
Oh.

256
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:42,439
I got it!

257
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,439
I got it!

258
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:49,240
I got it!

259
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,439
I got it!

260
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:51,439
Here it is.

261
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:54,039
What?

262
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,240
It's easy to guess, right?

263
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,639
I got it.

264
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,639
Wow!

265
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,439
Wow!

266
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:00,839
I know it so well.

267
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,820
ETTEN

268
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
Wow!

269
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,740
I can type it so fast.

270
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,840
I got it!

271
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,100
I can do it!

272
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,440
This voice is almost blank.

273
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,940
Yes, I can say it all.

274
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,240
I did it!

275
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,840
Wow!

276
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,240
GO!

277
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,120
Go!

278
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,560
And I've completed it!

279
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,040
This image that you mentioned in your dream.

280
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,280
It's called ICHIFUJI.

281
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,279
NITAKA FAN NASUBI

282
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,279
What does that mean?

283
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,279
What does that mean?

284
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,279
What does that mean?

285
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,279
What does that mean?

286
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,279
What does that mean?

287
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,279
It means you can see it as your first dream.

288
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,279
So,

289
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,279
So,

290
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,279
First Dream

291
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,279
Correct!

292
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,279
Yay!

293
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,279
I knew it!

294
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,279
It was a dream!

295
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,279
I want to see everyone's dream.

296
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,279
I'm glad.

297
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
Here is your first dream.

298
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,279
I see.

299
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,279
I see.

300
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,279
I see.

301
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,279
I see.

302
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,279
Next.

303
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,279
I thought it was New Year's Day.

304
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,279
I see.

305
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,279
But,

306
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,279
I wrote the date of the first, second, and third holidays.

307
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,279
I wrote the date of the first, second, and third holidays.

308
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,279
I wrote the date of the first, second, and third holidays.

309
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,279
Next.

310
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,279
I didn't know the information.

311
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,279
I didn't know the information.

312
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,279
I only wrote this part.

313
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,279
I only wrote this part.

314
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,279
You picked up the information properly.

315
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,279
You traced it.

316
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,279
I was glad it wasn't here.

317
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,279
I was glad it wasn't here.

318
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,279
I saw it and wrote it.

319
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,279
I saw it and wrote it.

320
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,279
You are a good writer.

321
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,279
You are a good writer.

322
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,279
You are a good writer.

323
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,279
Next.

324
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,279
I wrote the date of the first, second, and third holidays.

325
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,279
You drew it in the calculator.

326
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,279
You drew it in the calculator.

327
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,279
You drew it in the calculator.

328
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,279
I made a mistake in the equation.

329
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,279
But, I am a commoner.

330
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,279
I understood it at first glance.

331
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,279
I was surprised.

332
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,279
I thought you were a bug.

333
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,279
I am surprised.

334
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,279
I am surprised.

335
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,279
I am surprised.

336
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,279
We completed the mission.

337
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,279
We completed the mission.

338
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,279
You did a great job.

339
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,279
I'm so happy.

340
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,779
Now that we've made you feel better,

341
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:42,279
I'm sure the PR event at the Tower Records Shibuya will succeed.

342
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,279
We'll do our best.

343
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,279
Last!

344
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,279
Please take care of the poster.

345
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,279
Thank you.

346
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,279
Please take care of it.

347
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,279
Thank you.

348
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,279
Now, we have 22 out of 7 members.

349
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,279
Hello, everyone.

350
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,279
We are 22 out of 7.

351
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,279
The anime is about the story of the beginning.

352
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,279
The story of the beginning is about the beginning of the story.

353
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,279
The relationship between the characters is...

354
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
It's hard to see.

355
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,279
It starts from the beginning.

356
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,279
Who did you get along with?

357
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,279
That's right.

358
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,279
Is that so?

359
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,279
What kind of relationship was it at first?

360
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,279
I was excited to hear that.

361
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,279
The difference in the way of calling.

362
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,279
The way of calling?

363
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,279
That's right.

364
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,279
That's right.

365
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,279
And...

366
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,279
This girl and this girl are having a lot of fights.

367
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,279
That's right.

368
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,279
You can see a lot of different relationships.

369
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,279
On January 11th, the first broadcast will be on Toki Mx and BS11.

370
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,279
And...

371
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
It's a song.

372
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
I hope you can watch it.

373
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,279
Please take care of it.

374
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
Thank you.

375
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,279
I hope the anime hits.

376
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,279
That's all.

377
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,279
It was 22 out of 7.

378
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
Thank you.

379
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,279
So, this year's PR mission.

380
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,279
The last event in Tokyo has ended.

381
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,279
Yay!

382
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,279
Wow.

383
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,279
There were a lot of people.

384
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,279
It was a lot.

385
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,279
There were so many people.
