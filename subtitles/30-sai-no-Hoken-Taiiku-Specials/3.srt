1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you love me, please don't go anywhere alone.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Please take me with you whenever you go.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, I promise.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I will forgive you, King Ahaya.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to tell you that I love you.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to tell you that I love you.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to tell you that I love you.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want to tell you that I love you.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Even if I were to be new to you,

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I would like to express how much I love you.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When I see you,

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The End

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Episode 1

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The End

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 1

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Episode 1

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hahaha...

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hahaha...

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Even so, I'm glad I succeeded in my diet.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wow...

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Who do you think is to blame?

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hahaha...

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But, I was surprised that

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you were so cute.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hahaha...

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I won't take it anymore.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Haha...

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How cute you are, Ando-san.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ando-san and I,

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
today, finally, finally...

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ahhhh!

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Congratulations!

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Shoo!

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What should I do?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a stay-over trip, so that's what it is.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
After all...

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ahhhh!

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's just the right time!

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Shoo!

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hahaha...

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hahaha...

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
By the way, today's stay-over

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
has a private bath.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is that so?

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm going in with you.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What?

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Mokuto Chinken, the Sixth Stand

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Funky Smell

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hmm...

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ah, Ando-san?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Your comrade is...

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll protect him!

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll protect him!

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mokuto Chinken, the Sixth Stand Funky Smell

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you here?

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hmph! Adios!

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ah, Ando-san!

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Damn it! I won't let you do that!

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Rika-san!

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Kaopa!

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll play with you!

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm the Comrade of the Land!

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What's that?

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll take you down with me!

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah!

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Cherry Stream Attack!

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Cherry Stream Attack!

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How fast!

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll get you!

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You...

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You guys are...

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know, but you look like you're a good guy.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You don't know, but you look like you're a good guy.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
See? I chased you!

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We have to hurry up or we'll be late!

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We have to hurry up or we'll be late!

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Th-thank you...

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey, wait!

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What did you say?

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We're meat-eating,

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
so we're not limited in age, but...

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And we're wearing hats!

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And we're wearing hats!

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And we're wearing hats!

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And we're wearing hats!

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And we're wearing hats!

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And we're wearing hats!

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And we're wearing hats!

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Ando-san...

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Damn it! Where are you?

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Stop!

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Huh?

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll have you die here!

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Stop!

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's the official name of the Asadachi?

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's the official name of the Asadachi?

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Eh? Asadachi?

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Um...

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Seppa! The Night-time Ghostly Pop-up!

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ah!

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Eh? Ah!

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait, could it be...

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
H-Hoshi-kun! And...

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Spanking Wada-san?

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come on, hurry up!

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hurry up and go!

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you very much!

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you very much!

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you very much!

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you very much!

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What is the G-Spot G?

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What is the G-Spot G?

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is the G-Spot G?

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Seppa!

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Bremen Melt!

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bremen Melt!

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're good...

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're good...
