1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm a god!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm a god!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hmph, that's not a good ending.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm a god!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, let's go with this.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Nii-chan, what are you doing?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've decided on my next job.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was practicing introducing myself.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, that's great! That's unfair! I'm jealous!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I want to go with you!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, you can't take a criminal like yourself.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be of help to you, too!

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please, I beg you!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you really want to follow me,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
then I'll take this as a no.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Reader Brothers

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Episode 1

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,340
The

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Nii-chan, I'm embarrassed.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, you look good.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, why do you have to dress like this?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Listen, little brother.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You can't talk to a girl you like because you're nervous.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, you can dress like a girl and make her get used to you.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can relieve your stress and even get a mask.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's a godly idea.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hmph.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, next, I'll wear nurse clothes.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I can't throw away my school swimsuit.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And my office lady and police mask.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you a pervert?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Huh?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Brother?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The Nii-chan, you're a pervert, aren't you?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Silence

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Silence.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There are many people who say they're afraid of silence in conversation.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But conversations are not about talking to each other forever.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sometimes, there are times when we fall into silence.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The problem is that the person in conversation will be convinced that the person in question is anxious about that silence.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is that what you just said?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm not sure.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
In order to teach people about the 1st, you have to know about the 10th.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I just showed you the example.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's with that mouth?

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's with that mouth?
